The first observable trend is that there doesn't appear to be a correlation between the city latitude and cloudiness. There are quite a few cities clustered at 0 and 100, which suggests the variance is high.
The second observable trend is that the city latitude vs humidity analysis is clustered together outside of one city, which would be an outlier in this analysis.
The third trend is that there is a negative slope with the city latitude vs max temperature analysis. As the temperature reaches above 80 degrees and a lat of 0, then it goes downhill.
